## Why build this?

### A K Apart

Swatchmaker has been built to enter the [A K Apart](https://a-k-apart.com/) challenge. The idea is to make a compelling web experience in 10kb or less, without using libraries and frameworks on the front end.

At university I had the opportunity to study artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. I was struck by how concise and straightforward implementations of some fairly powerful techniques could be. K-means clustering is one of those, and Swatchmaker uses a crude implementation in the browser of around ~1kb in size.

A K Apart celebrates accessibility, web performance, and inclusive design. To that end I've tried to make this app work well for all kinds of user, including ones who don't have modern devices or can't use devices most of us take for granted, like a mouse for navigating around a web page.

This is still a work in progress. The challenge ends on 30th September, and I hope to fix some things and add some more features before then.
